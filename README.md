## Description

This is the fifth weekly challenge for my boot camp. This challenge involved creating a Work Day scheduler using javascript. This scheduler allows the user to plan their day by typing in the hour block and pressing the save button, doing so saves the data to your local storage. With the assistance of CSS and javascript future hour blocks are shown as green, past hour blocks shown as grey and current hour blocks shown as red.
